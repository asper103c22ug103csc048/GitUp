***Implement a class called BankAccount that represents a bank account. The class should have private
 attributes for account number, account holder name, and account balance. Include methods to
deposit money, withdraw money, and display the account balance. Ensure that the account balance
 cannot be accessed directly from outside the class. Write a program to create an instance of the
BankAccount class and test the deposit and withdrawal functionality. ***

. class BankAccount:

1 def __init__(self, account_number, account_holder_name, initial_balance=0.8):

self._account_number = account_number

self._account holder_name = account_holder_name

self.___account balance initial_balance
